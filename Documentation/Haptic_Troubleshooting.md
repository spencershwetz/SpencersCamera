# EVWheelPicker Haptic Feedback Troubleshooting

## Issue

Haptic feedback (vibration) is not being felt when interacting with the `EVWheelPicker` component (`iPhoneApp/Features/Camera/Views/EVWheelPicker.swift`), despite:

1.  System-level haptics being enabled in iPhone Settings (`Settings > Sounds & Haptics > System Haptics` is ON).
2.  Haptics working correctly in other applications on the same device.
3.  Debug logs confirming that the code intended to trigger haptics *is* being executed at the correct times (e.g., when crossing tick marks).

## Attempted Solutions (None Worked)

1.  **`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`:**
    *   Used `.heavy` style with `intensity: 1.0`.
    *   Triggered within the `updateValue` function when the step value changed.
    *   Logs confirmed `generator.impactOccurred()` was called.

2.  **SwiftUI `.sensoryFeedback` Modifier:**
    *   Used `.sensoryFeedback(.impact(weight: .heavy, intensity: 1.0), trigger: hapticTrigger)`.
    *   The `hapticTrigger` state variable (`Int`) was incremented when the step value changed.
    *   Logs confirmed the trigger function was called.

3.  **`UISelectionFeedbackGenerator`:**
    *   Instantiated a `@State` generator.
    *   Called `feedbackGenerator.prepare()` when the drag gesture began.
    *   Called `feedbackGenerator.selectionChanged()` directly within the `DragGesture.onChanged` callback whenever the calculated `targetIndex` changed.
    *   Logs confirmed `selectionChanged()` was called when crossing tick marks.

## Possible Remaining Causes

*   **Environmental Interference:** Something specific within the `EVWheelPicker`'s view hierarchy, its parent views (`CameraView`?), sibling views, or applied modifiers might be suppressing or interfering with the haptic system's ability to play feedback requested by this specific component.
*   **Gesture Conflicts:** Although seemingly simple, the `DragGesture` or its interaction with the parent view's gestures could potentially interfere.
*   **Threading Issues:** While standard SwiftUI views and generators should operate on the main thread, an unexpected background operation interfering is a remote possibility.
*   **App State Interference:** Some other state within the application (e.g., audio session configuration, background tasks, CoreHaptics engine usage elsewhere) might be inadvertently blocking UIKit haptics.
*   **Focus/Responder Chain:** Unlikely for these types of feedback, but perhaps the view or its window scene isn't in a state the haptic system expects.
*   **Device/OS Bug:** A specific, subtle bug related to the device model or iOS 18 build cannot be entirely ruled out, though less likely if other apps work.

## Next Steps / Ideas

*   **Simplify Trigger Context:** Add a simple `Button` directly inside `EVWheelPicker`'s body to manually trigger feedback. This helps isolate whether *any* haptic can originate from this view.
*   **Test in Isolation:** Create a completely separate, minimal SwiftUI view project containing *only* the `EVWheelPicker` (or a simplified version) and test haptics there.
*   **Trigger from Parent:** Move the haptic trigger logic to the parent view (`CameraView`) and trigger it based on the `@Binding var value` changing there (using `.onChange`).
*   **Use `UIDevice.current.playInputClick()`:** As a lower-level alternative, try calling this system sound/haptic method. It's not semantically ideal for selection, but might bypass potential blocks.
*   **Check Audio Session:** Review how the app configures its `AVAudioSession`. Certain configurations *might* interfere with haptics, although this is less common.
*   **Profile with Instruments:** Use the Haptics track in Instruments to see if the system is even *receiving* the haptic requests from the app process.
